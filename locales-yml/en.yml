        If you are in the Estate plan or above, you can have sections with
        dynamic fields appear based on the option selected in a dropdown field.
        You can add ticket fields to each section, and associate a section with
        options in the dropdown field. If you run an e-commerce store, for
        example, you can have a section open up with a field called 'Reason'
        when your customer chooses the option 'Replacement'. This way, you can
        better understand why your customer would like to have a replacement
        issued. You can create a maximum of two dynamic sections and use them in
        two custom dropdowns. If you've associated a section with the 'type'
        field already, you'll be able to add just one more section to the ticket
        form.
      title2: Dependent Fields
      tour: Help me understand ticket fields
      info_1: >-
        The ticket form helps capture the data you need from the customer when
        they submit a ticket. You can customize your Ticket Form to include the
        right ticket fields for your business, and let your customers and agents
        fill in the information you need in the format you want. For example, in
        an e-commerce company, getting a customer's order ID in the ticket form
        would be very helpful to the agent solving the ticket.
      title3: Dynamic Fields
      info2: >-
        Dependent Fields give you an easy way to create deeper ticket categories
        and identify the biggest issues that clog your support.  With dependent
        fields you can organize tickets hierarchically  into categories,
        subcategories and item affected.
      title1: Ticket Fields
      info4_v2: >-
        If you are in the estate plan or above, you can have dynamic fields that
        appear based on the option selected in the type field. For every option
        in the type field, you can create a different section. You can then add
        more ticket fields to each section. For example, in an ecommerce
        scenario, when the type is chosen as "Replacement", a section with a
        field called "Reason" can open up that will collect the reason why
        customer needs a replacement for the item.
